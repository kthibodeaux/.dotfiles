#dotfiles

Refactoring Emacs, building Vim config, and configuring Evil-mode.  Things will be messy for a while.

## vim todo
* better keymaps
- bind moving line(s) up/down (maybe ,mj and ,mk ?)
* better vimrc organization
* auto open all .md files as markdown
* plugins from vim awesome
- vim-rails
- vim-gitgutter
- indent guides
- emmet
- neocomplcache?
- ag.vim
- vim-autoclose
- rename.vim
- rvm.vim
- ctrlp-funky
- bundler.vim
- blockle.vim
- vim-ruby-runner?
- rubocop?
- ruby-lint?
- vim-rbfactor?
- vim-ruby-doc? or at least something similar
- unite? needs to be researched, initial look not clear enough on what it is, comparable to helm?

## misc todo
* find terminal jabber client comparible to jabber.el
- this is pretty much the only thing holding me to emacs
* switch from rvm to rbenv?

## emacs todo
* goodbye :)

## tmux on OSX
`brew install reattach-to-user-namespace`
